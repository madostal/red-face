# Red Face - security testing of web applications

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/0fef741942c5461ea9da0356c4b5b942)](https://www.codacy.com/app/JaLe/red-face?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=JaLe29/red-face&utm_campaign=badger)

## What is Red Face

* It's my diploma thesis - [Faculty of Applied Sciences of the University of West Bohemia in Pilsen](http://www.fav.zcu.cz/en/)
* Red Face is web applications which is created for web security testing
* APP is using React/SemanticUI views and uses a REST JSON API with MySQL database

## Types of security tests

* It will be added in the future

## Currently used frameworks:

* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
* [React Semantic UI](http://react.semantic-ui.com/)
* [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)
* [ES6](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/)
* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [React Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router)
* [StandardJS](http://standardjs.com/)

## Other Features

* Seemless pushState routing using React Router
* Uses Webpack/HTMLWebpackPlugin to generate an index.html that has cache friendly bundle loaders
* All CSS and assets served via Webpack/StyleLoader
* Uses Semantic UI as a rich UI element base
* Bundles are split between vendor and app for better bundling/loading performance
* All files are organized according to modern conventions. Component directory structure allows for expansion of multiple apps / subdomains
* Uses ES6 style React components
* Code hotswapping

## Install Dependencies

Run in the project root folder:

```bash
npm install
```

## Run

The following command serves all HTML/JS/CSS and watches all changes to `src/*.jsx`

```bash
npm start
```

UI is running at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

## Running the API 

```bash
node script/api.js
```

## Directory Structure

* `package.json` - Configure dependencies
* `webpack.config.js` - Bundling and build configuration
* `dist/*` - Files generated by webpack, incuding index.html. These are the assets that should be HTTP served
* `src/styles` - Home of style sheets
* `src/utils` - Home of specific JS helper utilities like for example `Api.js` for doing API requests
* `src/components` - Home of all React/JS components
* `src/components/common` - Common components that are shared throughout the app
* `src/components/pages` - Main domain/app folder. Contains an `App.jsx` and `Router.jsx`.
* `src/main.jsx` - Main entrypoint into application.
* `scripts/api.js` - REST JSON server

## Note

* The project is building from Simple JS App Skeleton [https://github.com/dominiek/app-skeleton](https://github.com/dominiek/app-skeleton) - Thank you dominiek
